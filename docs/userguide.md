title: Using Panic Button
---

Don't want the boss to catch you surfing the web on company time? Don't want
your teacher, classmates, roommate or significant other to see the web sites
youâ€™re viewing?

With Panic Button, a single click of a toolbar button will quickly hide all
Firefox browser windows and open a new window displaying a website of your
choice -- click the toolbar button again to bring back your browser windows.

### How To Use

Once Panic Button is installed, the Panic Button icon will appear in the
browser toolbar. When danger is coming, click on it to hide your browser
windows and tabs. A new browser window will open in its place, displaying the
Mozilla Firefox website. Once danger has passed, click the Panic Button icon
again to restore your browser windows, and pick up where you left off. Whew!

**Tip:** You can press the F8 key instead of clicking the Panic Button icon.

### Panic Button Actions

The default action that is triggered when clicking the Panic Button (or
pressing F8) is "Hide And Replace." You can change the Panic Button action from
the extension preferences page; for instructions, see
[Settings and Customizations](customize.md).

The following actions are available for triggering by Panic Button:

* **Hide And Replace** -- Hides all browser windows and replaces them with a
  browser window displaying a web page at a specific URL; click on the Panic
  Button again after danger has passed to restore the browser session. This is
  the default action.

* **Minimize All Windows** -- Minimizes all open browser windows. Option
  available to open a browser window displaying a web page at a specific URL.

* **Minimize Current Window** -- Minimizes just the currently-focused browser
  window, leaving the other browser windows intact.

* **Close All Windows** -- Closes all windows and quit Firefox if there are no
  other browser windows open


### Customizing the Panic Button Toolbar Button

You can also change the Panic Button icon as well as the keyboard shortcut for
triggering the Panic Button action.  For more details, see
[Settings and Customizations](customize.md).
