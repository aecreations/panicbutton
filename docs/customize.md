The extension preferences page is where you can change various options for
Panic Button, such as the action that is triggered when clicking the Panic
Button, the Panic Button toolbar button icon, and more.

To open the extension preferences page, do one of the following:

* Right-click on the Panic Button toolbar button and then select Panic Button
  Options from the context menu; or,

* Open Add-ons Manager (from the Firefox menu, click Add-ons and Themes), then
  in the list of installed add-ons, click the ... button for Panic Button and
  then select Options.

### Extension Preferences

The available options for Panic Button are grouped under two tabs in the
extension preferences page.

#### Options Tab

The Options tab is where the Panic Button action can be changed. Options are
available for each Panic Button action, except Close All Windows.

To learn more about what each Panic Button action does, see
[Using Panic Button](userguide.md).

**Hide and Replace**

* Web location (URL) -- Change the web address (URL) of the browser window that
  appears when your browser windows and tabs are hidden. By default, this is
  set to the Mozilla Firefox website.

* Set Password -- Optionally, you can set a password that must be entered to
  restore your browser session after danger has passed.

* When restoring browser session, snooze inactive browser tabs -- When this
  option is turned on, the browser tabs that are restored are suspended to
  reduce system resources (only the active tab is loaded). Turn off this option
  if you want all tabs to be fully loaded when your browser windows are
  restored.

**Minimize All Windows**

* Open a new window after all browser windows are minimized -- Select this
  option to make this action behave similarly to Hide And Replace. The web
  address (URL) of the new window can be changed; by default, it is set to the
  Mozilla Firefox website. To restore the minimized browser windows and tabs,
  click the Panic Button again.

**Minimize Current Window**

* Clicking the Panic Button on another window should -- This option temporarily
  changes the action that is triggered when the Panic Button toolbar button is
  clicked on a browser window that remains displayed, if there are any. You can
  choose to restore the minimized window, or minimize the window where the
  Panic Button toolbar button was clicked.

**Close All Windows**

No options are available for this action.


#### Customize Tab

The Customize tab is where the Panic Button toolbar button caption and icon can
be changed, as well as the keyboard shortcut.

The Panic Button toolbar button icon can be changed by selecting from the 20
icons listed in the icon picker, or you can choose an image file on your
computer. If you are using the Dark Mode system theme, it is recommended to select
the Reverse Contrast Toolbar Icon option so that the toolbar button icon blends
in better with Dark Mode colors (this option is not available if using a custom
image for the toolbar button icon).

**Tip:** You can quickly change the Panic Button toolbar button icon by
right-clicking on the toolbar button and then selecting Change Icon from the
context menu.
