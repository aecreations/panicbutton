# Panic Button
### Quickly hide all browser windows with a click of a button.

Don't want the boss to catch you surfing the web on company time?  Don't want your teacher, classmates, roommate or significant other to see the Web sites you're viewing?  With Panic Button, a single click of a toolbar button will quickly hide all Firefox windows -- bring them back by clicking a button on the Restore Session toolbar.  The Panic Button action can also be invoked by pressing F8.

Learn more and install the Firefox extension from the [AE Creations website](https://aecreations.io/panicbutton/).  Panic Button is also available from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/panic-button/).

If you are skilled at Firefox extension development and want to contribute code for a bug fix or a new feature, follow these instructions:

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/aecreations/panicbutton/issues/new) to describe your bug fix or feature.
2. Create a new branch originating from the branch for the current major version, `branches/5.0`.  The new branch is where you should commit your code changes.  The branch name should follow the naming convention `branches/your-branch-name`.
3. When your code changes are ready for review, open a pull request to merge to the branch for the current major version.  Ensure that your PR references the issue you created in step 1.
4. **IMPORTANT!**  The `master` branch contains the source code for the current release.  Do not commit directly to the `master` branch.
